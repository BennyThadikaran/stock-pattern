These were a series of pattern scanners I wrote for experimentation and fun in 2022. My inspiration was this Medium article [Algorithmically Detecting (and Trading) Technical Chart Patterns with Python](https://medium.com/automation-generation/algorithmically-detecting-and-trading-technical-chart-patterns-with-python-c577b3a396ed)

Understand how the code works: [wiki Pattern Algorithms](https://github.com/BennyThadikaran/stock-pattern/wiki/Pattern-Algorithms)

## Important Info

**All patterns are detected, prior to breakout.** at the last leg of the pattern. Add the stock to your watchlist and track them further.

This program does not provide any buy or sell signals. It only detects the pattern. It is upto you to decide, if a pattern is valid or tradeable.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BennyThadikaran/stock-pattern.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Setup configuration file with setup-config.py and answer the questions to generate a user.json

   ```bash
   py setup-config.py
   ```

   - Use direction keys to select a choice and press `ENTER`.
   - `TAB` key can be used to autocomplete filepaths. Use forward slashes `/` regardless of your OS to specify filepaths.
   - By default, filepath is mapped to your home folder `/home/YourUsername` on mac/linux and `C:/Users/YourUsername` on Windows.
   - You can use `../../` to go to C drive.

   **Alternatively, I've written step by step instructions to [create user.json manually](https://github.com/BennyThadikaran/stock-pattern/wiki/Writing-JSON-configuration-manually)**

# Disclaimer

This program identifies common chart patterns and does it reasonably well (IMHO).

Stock-Pattern is not aimed at replacing a trader's trained eye. It is merely an assistance and learning tool.

CLI options available, for you to backtest the patterns. If you intend to trade these patterns, study them well and trade at your own risk.
